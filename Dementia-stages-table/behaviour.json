    "text_01": "The way a person behaves depends on communication between the limbic system (which deals with emotions) and the frontal lobes (which deal with rational thoughts and judgements).",

    "text_02": "If these parts of the brain are damaged by dementia, this can cause a dramatic change to personality - often with misunderstood or fabricated responses i.e. feeling anxious without good cause, or react aggressively to a threat which is not there. This can also lead to inappropriate or contradictory behaviour - for example, a person laughing when they are told about a sad event. Damage to the limbic system may also lead to the person having delusions - for example, believing that someone is stealing things from them. "
