    "text_01": "Both the frontal and temporal lobes play a key role, and work in tandem, in our ability to communicate and speak. Damage to the frontal lobes will cause issues with control and regulation of communication, effecting the emotional aspect of social interaction or of interaction with others. Damage to the temporal lobes will affect knowledge and understanding of words and concepts, leading to word loss, not being able to follow a storyline and confusion in conversation. All of this will lead to decreased speech.  "
