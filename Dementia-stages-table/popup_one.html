						The following is an extract from a report by the Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch on the: Delayed Recognition of Aortic Dissection. The full report can be accessed <a href="https://www.hsib.org.uk/news/earlier-recognition-aortic-dissection-needed-prevent-deaths/" target="_blank" type="report">here</a>.

						From page 6 | <b>Reference Event</b> <br> <br>
						Richard was a fit 54-year-old man who experienced severe sudden onset chest pain while lifting weights in the gym. Although the pain subsequently reduced, he still felt unwell. After returning home and calling the NHS 111 service, Richard was taken to the emergency department (ED) of a local acute hospital by ambulance. The ambulance paramedics believed that the cause of the pain was probably musculoskeletal (from the muscles, bones or joints) but felt there was a need to rule out an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack).
					</p>
					
					<p>
						After waiting over 30 minutes for triage and, on his case being assigned as priority two (out of five, with one being the most urgent), Richard was placed in a low-dependency cubicle. During his time in the ED, Richard was seen by an advanced care practitioner and a second-year trainee doctor. The trainee doctor discussed the case with, and received advice from, a consultant. Richard initially appeared well but his condition subsequently deteriorated with further pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. His electrocardiogram (ECG) was normal but blood tests showed a very raised level of a significant blood chemical (D-dimers more than 3000ng/ml).
					
					</p>
					
					<p>
						After three hours in the department with no clear diagnosis, Richard was referred to the on-call medical team. The medical registrar was concerned about the possibility of an acute aortic dissection (AD) and requested an urgent computed tomography aortogram (CTA) scan, which confirmed the diagnosis of an extensive aortic dissection (Stanford type A).
					</p>
					
					<p>
						After an hour waiting for a formal report of the scan, Richard was sent by ambulance to the regional specialist centre for heart and chest surgery but suffered a cardiac arrest during the journey and died
					</p>

					<p>
						From page 7 | <b>Findings </b> <br> <br>
						• The medical professionals who treated Richard prior to his hospital admission and in the ED did not recognise that the sudden onset of severe chest pain might be a symptom typical of acute AD.
					</p>

					<p>
						• There appeared to be a lack of awareness among medical staff of the most common symptoms and signs of acute AD and the limitations of measuring the blood pressure in both arms as a diagnostic test for this condition. There also appeared to be confusion for some staff between the presentation of an acute thoracic AD and an abdominal aortic aneurysm.
					</p>

					<p>
						• The NHS 111 triage resulted in an appropriate response, but the patient was advised to take aspirin, which could have had serious adverse consequences in this condition.
					</p>

					<p>
						• Richard was taken to hospital to rule out an acute myocardial infarction as the cause of chest pain. However, he waited over 30 minutes for triage and, although his case was assigned to priority two (of five, with one being the most urgent), Richard was then placed in a low-dependency cubicle.
					</p>

					<p>
						• Although Richard’s pain could not be reproduced in a way which would have positively supported the presence of a musculoskeletal injury, there was some reluctance to relinquish this as a possible diagnosis while the possibility of a more serious heart or lung problem was being explored.

					<p>
						• During his time in the ED, Richard was not seen by a consultant but by an advanced care practitioner
						and a foundation year two (FY2) doctor. The FY2 doctor discussed the case with, and received advice from, a consultant.
					</p>

					<p>
						• There was a delay in escalation of the case of an apparently well patient with a history of chest pain but without a clear diagnosis.
					</p>

					<p>
						• A chest X-ray taken in the ED was incorrectly interpreted as normal. A chest X-ray is not a suitable investigation for detecting acute AD.
					</p>

					<p>
						• The current Royal College of Emergency Medicine standards for management of radiology results were complied with.
					</p>

					<p>
						• The delay in this case - of around four hours in the hospital - before reaching the diagnosis of acute
						AD is not unusual.
