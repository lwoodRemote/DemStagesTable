    "text_01": "The limbic system is a collection of regions in the brain that are involved in processing emotions. It includes the amygdala, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and thalamus. Damage to the limbic system is common in most forms of dementia and it can change the way a person feels or would normally react. A person may feel more excited, anxious, sad or apathetic than before they developed dementia."
