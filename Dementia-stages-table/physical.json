    "text_02": "The medical term for swallowing difficulties is Dysphagia, and this can occur in moderate to advanced dementia. Dysphagia can be caused by changes that occur in the brain as well as environmental challenges. (e.g. a noisy or new dining experience). \n \nDamage to the front lobes (which deal with information that is stored and processed) can alter rational decision making and judgements; including decisions that are made about food. This can cause a loss of appetite, a change to perceived taste and preferred food, fear of choking etc. \n \nIn addition, damage to the central nervous system caused by dementia can physically change the swallowing neural path - specifically to the cerebral cortex and/or the medulla oblongata whose function is to transmit signals between the spinal cord and the brain, controlling autonomic processes like swallowing. \n",

    "text_03": "Persons with dementia can experience impaired vision, even though they might have healthy eyes. \n \nDamage to the occipital lobes will result in a person having trouble working out what is in front of them. If there is damage to the right parietal lobe, then the person might have problems with judging distances in three dimensions. \n \nDamage to the temporal lobes will affect knowledge and understanding of words and concepts, leading to word loss, not being able to follow a storyline and confusion in conversation. All of this will lead to decreased speech."
